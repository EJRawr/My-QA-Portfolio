          I worked as a Quality Assurance Game Tester, collaborating with the QA and Development teams to make sure every build delivered the best gameplay experience possible. 
          I handled manual testing, bug reporting, and test case execution, while also helping maintain QA documentation. 
          My work included running regression, smoke, and acceptance tests to keep the games stable and fun to play across different platforms.

          I worked as a Quality Assurance Game Tester, collaborating closely with the QA Lead and Development team to ensure a smooth and balanced gameplay experience. 
          I performed playtesting, executed detailed test cases covering gameplay mechanics, UI, character abilities, and damage calculations, and reported bugs using tools like Asana and Jira. 
          I also prepared reports for smoke and regression testing to help track progress and maintain game stability throughout development.
